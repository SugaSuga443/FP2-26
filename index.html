              <p>I’m Antoinette Lonon, a highly motivated and experienced professional with a 22-year background in education. I transitioned to office management in 2023, leveraging my collaborative skills and passion for technology. During my teaching career, I thrived in cooperative environments, working with colleagues to develop engaging learning experiences. The shift to remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a newfound interest in computer applications and programming. As an office manager, I regularly utilize various software programs, including creating forms, managing data in spreadsheets, and updating the school website.
                Dedicated to continuous improvement, I have pursued professional development opportunities to enhance my office management skills. A workshop with The Knowledge House ignited my interest in the vast potential of technology careers, specifically web development. While currently a novice in this field, I am eager to learn and embrace the latest advancements in web development. I am enthusiastic about collaborating and contributing to innovative projects.

              <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p>I'm Antoinette Lonon, and I'm an Atlanta native! My love for kids led me to spend 22 years as a teacher, and I absolutely loved it. I worked with some amazing colleagues to create inspiring learning spaces for the kids, using everything from good old-fashioned paper and pens to laptops and tablets – whatever worked best! Then the pandemic hit, and I discovered this whole new world of working with computers that I just fell in love with. Even after we went back to the classroom, I knew I wanted to explore that side of things more.
                So, while I'm not in the classroom anymore, I'm still passionate about education and making a difference. I'm now the office manager at a preschool, and I work closely with the director and board members, doing all sorts of things – creating forms and spreadsheets, updating the website, the whole nine yards. And honestly, this job has just fueled my passion for computers even more, to the point where I'm really excited about diving into web development!
